            "Answer: ColBERT is a ranking model that uses a late interaction architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant passages. It adapts deep language models, specifically BERT, for efficient retrieval by encoding the query and document separately and then using a cheap yet powerful interaction step to model their similarity. This allows ColBERT to leverage the expressiveness of deep language models while pre-computing document representations offline, speeding up query processing. ColBERT's interaction mechanism also enables it to leverage vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from millions of documents. It has been shown to be effective and efficient, outperforming non-BERT baselines while executing queries much faster and requiring fewer computational operations.\n",
